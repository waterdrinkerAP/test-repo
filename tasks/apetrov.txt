Nothing to see here, move along.
Are you familiar with the story of darth plagueis the wise?
It's not a story the jedi would tell you.
It's a sith legend. Darth plagueis was a dark lord of the sith,
so powerful and so wise he could use the force to influence the
midichlorians to create life. He had such a knowledge of the dark
side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.
The dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
